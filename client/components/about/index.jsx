							<h2>About</h2>
							<p>
							I hold American, Canadian, and Korean passports, but really identify myself as a citizen of the world. Born in Toronto, I spent most of my formative years in the Bay Area. Fueled by a desire to explore an unknown city and an interest with working in a quantitative field, I left for New York University and graduated with a B.S. in Finance, after which I worked on trading floors for a few yearsâ€”long enough to know that I had zero interest in working in the world of finance.
							</p>
							<p>
							I started writing macros in VBA, which then turned into learning SQL and some Python as I got more comfortable with coding while working as a data analyst, and even as a chef (another story for another time). Along the way, Iâ€™ve discovered a passion for building applications that Iâ€™m unable to shake. I love what I do and am looking forward to all the cool things that I'll inevitably be a part of.
							</p>
							<p>
							Letâ€™s build something awesome together ðŸ™Œ.

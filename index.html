<h1>About</h1>
Hello.

I’m Eugene, a software engineer based in Oakland. I love turning abstract ideas into useful applications that people can use to improve their quality of life. I believe in taking the time to do things the right way the first time. I operate on the principle that everyone has something to teach me. I live for the elusive moments of clarity and accomplishment that come with the completion of a job well done. I look forward to a future where an increasingly digital world allows people to spend more time doing the things they love.

<div class="bio">
<h1>Bio</h1>
<p>
I hold American, Canadian, and Korean passports, but really identify myself as a citizen of the world. Born in Toronto, I spent most of my formative years in the Bay Area. Fueled by a desire to explore an unknown city and an interest with working with numbers and logic, I left for New York University and graduated with a B.S. in Finance, after which I worked on trading floors for a few years—long enough to know that I had zero interest in working in the world of finance.
</p>
<p>
I moved back to the Bay Area and graduated from the University of San Francisco for an M.B.A. in Entrepreneurship, after which I worked as a business / data analyst for a few years. I soon came to realize that I needed to be building/creating, and decided to try something completely different and worked as a chef at a Michelin-starred restaurant.
</p>
<p>
Be it BASIC and HTML while in high school, VBA while in finance, or SQL and some Python while in software, I built my own bootstrapped tools to automate tasks and make everyone’s work more efficient. I started to teach myself to code in the free time I had during and after my chefing time, and ultimately enrolled and completed the advanced immersive program at Hack Reactor. Along the way, I’ve discovered a passion for building applications that I’m unable to shake even if I wanted to.
</p>
<p>
Constant to my life over the years has been the desire to create mental or physical discomfort in my life as a way of strengthening myself for the challenges that inevitably lie ahead. If I’m not being challenged, then I know that I’m not growing. Bottom line: I love what I do and will do whatever it takes to further my career.
</p>
<p>
Let’s build something awesome together.

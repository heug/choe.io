		<h1>About</h1>
		I’m Eugene, a software engineer based in Oakland. I love turning abstract ideas into useful applications that people can use to improve their quality of life. I believe in taking the time to do things the right way the first time. I operate on the principle that everyone has something to teach me. I live for the elusive moments of clarity and accomplishment that come with the completion of a job well done. I look forward to a future where an increasingly digital world allows people to spend more time doing the things they love.

		<h1>Bio</h1>
		<p>
		I hold American, Canadian, and Korean passports, but really identify myself as a citizen of the world. Born in Toronto, I spent most of my formative years in the Bay Area. Fueled by a desire to explore an unknown city and an interest with working in a quantitative field, I left for New York University and graduated with a B.S. in Finance, after which I worked on trading floors for a few years—-long enough to know that I had zero interest in working in the world of finance.
		</p>
		<p>
		I spent some time as a data analyst until I was laid off, and the combination of feeling like I was at a transitional point in life and the desire to have a career experiment which I found to be a great time to explore a serious hobby of mine and worked my way onto the line at a Michelin-starred restaurant. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Passion is great, but the desire for intellectual stimulation was too great for me to ignore. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Be it BASIC and HTML while in high school, VBA while in finance, or SQL and some Python while in software, I built my own bootstrapped tools to automate tasks and make everyone’s work more efficient. I started to teach myself to code in the free time I had during and after my chefing time, and ultimately enrolled in and completed the immersive program at Hack Reactor. Along the way, I’ve discovered a passion for building applications that I’m unable to shake even if I wanted to.
		</p>
		<p>
		Bottom line: I love what I do and will do whatever it takes to further my career.
		</p>
		<p>
		Let’s build something awesome together.

<!-- Constant to my life over the years has been the desire to create mental or physical discomfort in my life as a way of strengthening myself for the challenges that inevitably lie ahead. If I’m not being challenged, then I know that I’m not growing.  -->
